# Quantifico

Quantifico is a Mobile app that was designed to provide the users valuable insights on their company. The data is presented in a visual manner through multiple types of plots, making it extremely simple to digest.

## Architecture

For this project I've used the [BloC pattern](https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/08/reactive-programming-streams-bloc/) and the library [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) which helps to implement it. I strongly recommend to read about it before diving into the code.

## DISCLAIMER

Although this project is supposed to run on both mobile platforms (Android and iOS), I've only tested it on Android.
